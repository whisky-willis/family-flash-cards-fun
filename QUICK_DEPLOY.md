Open browser console (F12) and you'll see:
```
Setting up name cycling interval

Cycling from 2 to 0
```

## 📦 Files Ready for Deployment

## 🚨 If Names Still Don't Cycle

1. **Check JavaScript is enabled** in your browser
2. **Open console** (F12) to see debug logs
3. **Wait 2 seconds** - the first change happens after 2 seconds
4. **Hard refresh** (Ctrl+F5) to clear cache
