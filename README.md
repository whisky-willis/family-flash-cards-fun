### Authentication Security
- **Strong Password Requirements**: 8+ characters with mixed case, numbers, and symbols
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
- **Input Sanitization**: XSS prevention and HTML tag removal
- **Generic Error Messages**: Prevents information disclosure to attackers

### File Upload Security
- **File Type Validation**: Only JPEG, PNG, GIF, and WebP files accepted
- **Size Limits**: Maximum 5MB file size
- **Dimension Limits**: Maximum 4000x4000 pixel dimensions
- **Secure Processing**: Validated file content and format checking

### Data Protection
- **Environment Variables**: API keys and secrets stored securely
- **Session Management**: Automatic session timeout and cleanup
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based protection for form submissions
- **Anonymous User Management**: Automatic cleanup after 24 hours

### Security Headers
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Prevents XSS and injection attacks
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS connections
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing

### Development Security
- **Secure Dependencies**: Regular security audits and updates
- **Code Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling without information disclosure

For detailed security implementation information, see:
- `AUTHENTICATION_SECURITY_REVIEW.md` - Security analysis and findings
- `SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Implementation details and deployment guide

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. Never commit `.env` files to version control
2. Regularly update dependencies with security patches
3. Test all authentication flows thoroughly
4. Validate all user inputs on both client and server side
5. Use HTTPS in production environments

### For Deployment
1. Set environment variables in your hosting platform
2. Enable security headers (automatically configured)
3. Test file upload restrictions
4. Monitor for failed authentication attempts
5. Regularly audit security configurations

**Security Level**: HIGH ‚úÖ  
**Ready for Production**: YES ‚úÖ
