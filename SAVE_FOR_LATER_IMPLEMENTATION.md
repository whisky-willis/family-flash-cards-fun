# Save for Later Email Signup Implementation

## Overview
Added email signup functionality to the "Save for Later" feature in Kindred Cards, allowing users to create accounts via email verification and persist their draft cards.

## Components Added

### 1. EmailSignupModal (`src/components/EmailSignupModal.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Dedicated modal for email-only signup when users click "Save for Later"
- **Features**:
  - Email validation (format, required field)
  - Supabase email signup integration
  - Draft card persistence to localStorage before signup
  - Success/error states with appropriate messaging
  - Mobile-responsive design
  - Loading states and proper UX feedback

### 2. AuthCallback Page (`src/pages/AuthCallback.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Dedicated route to handle email verification redirects from Supabase
- **Features**:
  - Processes Supabase auth tokens automatically
  - Draft card migration from localStorage to user account
  - Visual feedback with loading, success, and error states
  - Automatic redirect to create-cards after successful verification
  - Comprehensive error handling and user guidance

## Modified Components

### CreateCards.tsx Updates
- **Import**: Added EmailSignupModal import
- **State**: Added `showEmailSignupModal` state
- **Handler**: Updated `handleSaveCollection()` to show EmailSignupModal instead of AuthModal for unauthenticated users
- **Success Handler**: Added `handleEmailSignupSuccess()` for post-signup feedback
- **JSX**: Added EmailSignupModal component alongside existing AuthModal

### App.tsx Updates
- **Routing**: Updated `/create` route to `/create-cards` for consistency
- **New Route**: Added `/auth-callback` route for email verification handling
- **Navigation**: All navigation links updated to use `/create-cards`

## Workflow

### 1. User Creates Cards
- User creates draft cards on the CreateCards page
- Cards are stored in component state and can be previewed

### 2. Save for Later Click
- User clicks "Save for Later" button
- If user is not authenticated, EmailSignupModal opens
- If user is already authenticated, cards save directly

### 3. Email Signup Process
- User enters email address
- Email validation occurs (format, required)
- Draft cards are saved to localStorage before signup
- Supabase Auth sends verification email
- Modal shows success state with email confirmation

### 4. Email Verification
- User clicks verification link in email
- Browser redirects to `/auth-callback` with Supabase auth tokens
- AuthCallback page processes authentication and migrates draft cards
- User sees success feedback and is automatically redirected to `/create-cards`
- User can continue creating cards with their saved collection

### 5. Error Handling
- Invalid email formats
- Duplicate email addresses
- Verification failures
- Card migration errors
- Network errors

## Technical Details

### Email Signup Configuration
```typescript
await supabase.auth.signUp({
  email: email,
  password: crypto.randomUUID(), // Random password for email-only signup
  options: {
    emailRedirectTo: `${window.location.origin}/auth-callback`,
    data: {
      signup_type: 'save_for_later',
      has_draft_cards: cards.length > 0
    }
  }
});
```

### Draft Card Persistence
- Cards saved to localStorage with key `kindred-cards-draft`
- Automatic cleanup after successful migration
- Error recovery if localStorage quota exceeded

### Email Verification Processing
```typescript
// In AuthCallback page - handles email verification redirect
const { data: { session }, error } = await supabase.auth.getSession();

if (session?.user?.user_metadata?.signup_type === 'save_for_later') {
  const draftCards = getDraft();
  
  // Save all draft cards as a single collection
  const cardsData = draftCards.map(card => {
    const { id, ...cardData } = card;
    return cardData;
  });
  
  await supabase.from('card_collections').insert({
    user_id: session.user.id,
    cards: cardsData,
    created_at: new Date().toISOString()
  });
  
  clearDraft();
  navigate('/create-cards');
}
```

## User Experience Features

### Mobile Responsive
- Modal adapts to smaller screens

### Loading States
- Spinner animations during email sending

### Toast Notifications
- Success messages for email sent

- Users can set custom passwords later via password reset
- Prevents credential-based attacks

### Token Security
- Supabase handles secure token generation
- Tokens expire automatically
- Single-use verification tokens

### Data Protection
- Draft cards only in localStorage temporarily
- Automatic cleanup after migration
- No sensitive data in URL parameters
