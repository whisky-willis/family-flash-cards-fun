# Save for Later Email Signup Implementation

## Overview
Added email signup functionality to the "Save for Later" feature in Kindred Cards, allowing users to create accounts via email verification and persist their draft cards.

## Components Added

### 1. EmailSignupModal (`src/components/EmailSignupModal.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Dedicated modal for email-only signup when users click "Save for Later"
- **Features**:
  - Email validation (format, required field)
  - Supabase email signup integration
  - Draft card persistence to localStorage before signup
  - Success/error states with appropriate messaging
  - Mobile-responsive design
  - Loading states and proper UX feedback

### 2. Email Verification Integration (CreateCards.tsx)
- **Purpose**: Handles email verification automatically when users are redirected back to the app
- **Features**:
  - Automatic detection of verified email signup users
  - Draft card migration from localStorage to user account
  - Success/error toast notifications
  - Seamless integration with existing card creation flow
  - Automatic cleanup of verification metadata

## Modified Components

### CreateCards.tsx Updates
- **Import**: Added EmailSignupModal import
- **State**: Added `showEmailSignupModal` state
- **Handler**: Updated `handleSaveCollection()` to show EmailSignupModal instead of AuthModal for unauthenticated users
- **Success Handler**: Added `handleEmailSignupSuccess()` for post-signup feedback
- **Email Verification**: Added useEffect to detect verified users and migrate draft cards automatically
- **JSX**: Added EmailSignupModal component alongside existing AuthModal

### App.tsx Updates
- **Routing**: Updated `/create` route to `/create-cards` for consistency
- **Navigation**: All navigation links updated to use `/create-cards`

## Workflow

### 1. User Creates Cards
- User creates draft cards on the CreateCards page
- Cards are stored in component state and can be previewed

### 2. Save for Later Click
- User clicks "Save for Later" button
- If user is not authenticated, EmailSignupModal opens
- If user is already authenticated, cards save directly

### 3. Email Signup Process
- User enters email address
- Email validation occurs (format, required)
- Draft cards are saved to localStorage before signup
- Supabase Auth sends verification email
- Modal shows success state with email confirmation

### 4. Email Verification
- User clicks verification link in email
- Browser redirects to `/create-cards` with Supabase auth tokens
- CreateCards page automatically detects verified user
- Draft cards migrate from localStorage to user account
- User sees welcome message and can continue creating cards

### 5. Error Handling
- Invalid email formats
- Duplicate email addresses
- Verification failures
- Card migration errors
- Network errors

## Technical Details

### Email Signup Configuration
```typescript
await supabase.auth.signUp({
  email: email,
  password: crypto.randomUUID(), // Random password for email-only signup
  options: {
    emailRedirectTo: `${window.location.origin}/create-cards`,
    data: {
      signup_type: 'save_for_later',
      has_draft_cards: cards.length > 0
    }
  }
});
```

### Draft Card Persistence
- Cards saved to localStorage with key `kindred-cards-draft`
- Automatic cleanup after successful migration
- Error recovery if localStorage quota exceeded

### Email Verification Detection
```typescript
// In CreateCards useEffect
if (user && !isAnonymous && user.user_metadata?.signup_type === 'save_for_later') {
  // Migrate draft cards and show welcome message
  const draftCards = getDraft();
  // ... migration logic
}
```

## User Experience Features

### Mobile Responsive
- Modal adapts to smaller screens
- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Proper keyboard navigation

### Loading States
- Spinner animations during email sending
- Progress indicators during card migration
- Disabled states to prevent duplicate actions

### Toast Notifications
- Success messages for email sent
- Error messages for validation failures
- Confirmation for successful verification
- Card migration status updates

### Error Recovery
- Clear error messages with actionable guidance
- Fallback options for failed operations
- Contact support information for persistent issues

- Tokens expire automatically
- Single-use verification tokens

### Data Protection
- Draft cards only in localStorage temporarily
- Automatic cleanup after migration
