surge
# Follow prompts to create account and deploy
```

## 📱 Option 5: Firebase Hosting
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase init hosting
# Select dist as public folder
firebase deploy
```

## 🐳 Option 6: Docker (For custom servers)
Create `Dockerfile`:
```dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY dist/ /usr/share/nginx/html/
EXPOSE 80

```bash
docker build -t family-cards .
docker run -p 8080:80 family-cards
```

## 🎯 What You'll See After Deployment
- Homepage with cycling names: "Help George learn about..." → "Help Maggie learn about..." → "Help Tom learn about..."
- Names change every 2 seconds automatically
- Fully responsive design
- All original functionality preserved

## 🔧 Development Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally

## 🚨 Troubleshooting
- If routes don't work: Ensure SPA redirect rules are configured
- If styles are broken: Check base URL in `vite.config.ts`
- If names don't cycle: Check JavaScript is enabled in browser

Choose the deployment method that works best for you! The Lovable platform option is the quickest if you want to get it live immediately.
